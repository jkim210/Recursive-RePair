Tools from the original repair library not used in BigRePair and therefore not tested. 

Both repair versions take as an additional parameter an integer providing the amount of available RAM in MB. The use of such limit only affects the running time, not the shape of the grammar

These versions can generate very deep rules and therefore should not be used: use the code in *largeb_repair* instead.
