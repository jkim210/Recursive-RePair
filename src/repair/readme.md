Tools from the repair library slightly modified to work within BigRePair

* **irepair**, **idespair** RePair compression and decompression for sequences of 32 bit integers

* **despair** RePair decompression for the output of the char based BigRePair (the format differs from the original char-based Repair because the alphabet map is missing, see commment in *despair.c*)
